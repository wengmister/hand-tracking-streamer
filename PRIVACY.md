Last Updated: 02/03/2026

1. Introduction
Hand Tracking Streamer ("we," "our," or "us") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes how we handle information when you use our hand-tracking streaming application on Meta Quest devices. We are committed to transparency regarding the data we access and how it is used.

2. Data Collection and Usage (VRC.Quest.Privacy.2 & 3)
Hand Tracking Data
Our application accesses Hand Tracking data provided by the Meta Quest operating system.

Data Accessed: Hand pose, finger orientation, and estimated hand size.

Purpose of Use: This data is used solely to enable real-time control and interaction within the application. Specifically, it is used to stream hand and wrist landmark data to your paired workstation for downstream use.

Collection & Storage: We do not collect, save, or store hand tracking data on our servers. The data is processed locally on your device (and optionally transmitted to your local paired PC) and is discarded immediately after use.

Microphone & Audio: We do not use microphone or audio.

Storage: We do not record or store audio data.

Personal Information
We do not collect personally identifiable information (PII) such as your name, email address, IP address, or location history. We do not use cookies or tracking pixels.

3. Data Transmission and Security (VRC.Quest.Privacy.5)
Our application may transmit data (such as hand tracking coordinates) from your headset to a paired device (e.g., your local PC) over your local network.

Local Transmission: This transmission occurs directly between your devices via your local Wi-Fi or USB connection.

No Cloud Upload: This data is not sent to external cloud servers or the internet.

Security: We utilize standard local network protocols to ensure this data is only accessible to the devices you have explicitly paired.

4. User Data Deletion (VRC.Quest.Privacy.4)
According to Meta's requirements, users must have a mechanism to request data deletion.

Our Policy: Since we do not collect or store any personal user data on our servers, there is no data record to delete.

Inquiries: If you have questions or wish to confirm that no data exists for your account, you may contact us at wengmister@gmail.com. We will respond to all valid requests.

5. Third-Party Sharing
We do not share, sell, or rent any user data to third parties, advertisers, or analytics providers.

6. Children’s Privacy
Our application is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
