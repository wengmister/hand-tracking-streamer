**Last Updated:** 02/06/2026

## 1. Introduction 
This Privacy Policy applies to the Hand Tracking Streamer application (the “Application”) published on Meta Quest platforms.

The Application is developed and published by Zhengyang Kris Weng (the “Developer,” “we,” “our,” or “us”). This Privacy Policy describes how we handle information when you use the Application on Meta Quest devices. We are committed to transparency regarding the data we access and how it is used.

## 2. Data Collection and Usage (VRC.Quest.Privacy.2 & 3)

We do not collect, store, or share any personal data.

### Hand Tracking Data

Our application accesses Hand Tracking data provided by the Meta Quest operating system.

- **Data Accessed:** Hand pose, finger orientation, and estimated hand size.
- **Purpose of Use:** This data is used solely to enable real-time control and interaction within the application. Specifically, it is used to stream hand and wrist landmark data to your paired workstation for downstream use.
- **Collection & Storage:** We do not collect, save, or store hand tracking data on our servers. The data is processed locally on your device (and optionally transmitted to your local paired PC) and is discarded immediately after use.

### Microphone & Camera

- **Camera:** We do not access, collect, or store raw image data from device cameras.
- **Microphone:** We do not access the microphone and do not record audio.

### Personal Information

We do not collect personally identifiable information (PII) such as your name, email address, IP address, or location history. We do not use cookies or tracking pixels.

## 3. Data Transmission

Our application requires the `INTERNET` permission solely to enable local network communication.

- **Local Streaming:** Hand tracking data is transmitted directly from your headset to your paired PC via your local Wi-Fi or USB connection.
- **No Cloud Upload:** No data is sent to external servers, third-party cloud services, or the public internet.

## 4. Third-Party Data Sharing
We do not share any user data with third parties.

## 5. User Data Deletion
Because we do not collect or store any user data, there is no data record to delete. If you wish to confirm this or have questions, you may contact us at wengmister@gmail.com.

## 6. Children's Privacy
Our application is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children.
